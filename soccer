<p> Kyle Hunt has been the best thing that has happened to this team, According to Kabai Mohlatsane who was one of the players on the team. 
He also says that; They didn't just grow as a team but also as men. They have grown closer to the Lord and sent him on the field. 
It has been the best season i have ever had. Last season we made it to the state Championship Playoff game we lost agaist one of the best team. 
But we are still encougared by Our coach that we are more capable of winning the State Next year. We have aready started our team meeting and
workouts for ththe worksouts for the next season.
